## üöÄ Welcome to the Project!

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **Fragments of Aetherion**, a passion project born from a deep love for expansive worlds and challenging combat. I am developing this game as a solo creator, dedicating my time to bringing a massive vision to life in Unity 6. My goal is to create a dark sci-fi adventure inspired by the sense of discovery in games like *Elden Ring*, but with a unique narrative set in a shattered, futuristic universe.

---

## üéÆ The Game Vision

My mission is to build an immersive universe where the echoes of a broken civilization tell a story. Players will navigate a treacherous world, master a rewarding combat system, and confront fearsome bosses, all while uncovering the secrets of the ancient Aetherion energy. It's a game about exploration, mastery, and survival in a beautiful, corrupted world.

## üìú Lore & Story

### A Tale of Ruin

The world was shattered when "The Consortium," a once-glorious federation of science-cities, attempted to harness the primordial energy source known as the Aetherion. They sought infinite power, but their ambition led to a cataclysm. The Aetherion's core imploded, corrupting the landscape and twisting living creatures into monstrous abominations.

You are **Kael**, a lone explorer from a forgotten lineage of "Aetherion Bearers"‚Äîindividuals uniquely resilient to the energy's destructive effects. Your journey is not one of conquest, but of restoration. You must collect the scattered **Aetherion Fragments** hidden by ancient bosses and forge a "Core Key" to seal the Aetherion's core for good.

### Key Threats

Your path is blocked by those who hold the Aetherion Fragments. They are not merely bosses, but corrupted reflections of the world's past.

| Boss Name | Description | Combat Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Veyra, the Smothering Queen** | A master of evasion who controls a city cloaked in toxic gas. | Evasive, Hit-and-Run. |
| **Tharos, the Bound Giant** | A colossal golem bound by energy chains, whose every step shakes the earth. | Slow, Area-of-Effect. |
| **Irelis, the Aetherion Archbishop** | A fanatic who fused with the Aetherion, wielding pure energy and dual blades. | Fast, Elemental. |
| **Nyrr, the Shadow Hunter** | A swift and cunning hunter who stalks the dark corners of the world. | Stealth, High Speed. |
| **The Core Entity** | The source of it all, a final, reality-bending confrontation with the very essence of the Aetherion. | Surreal, Multi-Phase. |

## üí° My Philosophy: The Solo Creator's Journey

This project is a testament to what a single developer can achieve. I believe in a holistic approach to game development, where design, storytelling, and code all come together to create a cohesive experience. Every asset, every line of code, and every design choice is a product of my personal vision and hard work. This is a human-led project, driven by passion and a commitment to quality.

## üé® Art & Asset Guidelines

### A Unified Vision

The art for **Fragments of Aetherion** is meticulously crafted to tell a cohesive story. My style is a blend of brutalist sci-fi and natural decay. I'm looking for assets that feel both ancient and futuristic‚Äîweapons and armor that look salvaged, and environments that are hauntingly beautiful.

### Asset Naming & Formats

Please follow these guidelines to keep our asset library organized and clean.

* **3D Models:** `.FBX`
* **Textures:** `.PNG` (for PBR maps like Albedo, Normal, Roughness, Metalness)
* **Animations:** `.FBX`

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat & Progression System

### The Philosophy of Combat

In **Fragments of Aetherion**, combat is about more than just numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs about timing, positioning, and skill. Every encounter should feel dangerous and meaningful. I've designed a system that is easy to learn but difficult to master, with a focus on strategic play.

### Core Mechanics

* **Light & Heavy Attacks:** Your basic tools. Light attacks are fast and good for combos. Heavy attacks are slower but can stagger enemies and break their guard.
* **Dodge & Parry:** Your best friends. A well-timed dodge can save your life, and a perfect parry can leave a boss vulnerable.
* **Weapon Abilities:** Each weapon can be imbued with an Aetherion Fragment, unlocking powerful, unique abilities like a fiery slash or a lightning strike.

### Player Progression

Your character‚Äôs development is based on three unique paths, powered by the Aetherion Fragments you collect from defeated bosses.

| Path Name | Description | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Path of the Blade** | For those who live and die by the sword. | Melee Combat, High Damage |
| **Path of the Wanderer** | Enhances your survival skills. | Exploration, Stamina, Inventory |
| **Path of the Aetherion** | Focuses on harnessing the raw power of the Aetherion. | Special Abilities, Energy Control |

## ‚öôÔ∏è In-Game UI & Menus

### The Goal

Our UI is designed to be unobtrusive and immersive. The aesthetic is clean, sci-fi, and slightly melancholic, reflecting the game's atmosphere.

### The Main Menu

The first thing a player sees is the Main Menu, a view of the shattered world of Aetherion. The UI elements are sleek and minimalist.

* **New Game:** Begin your adventure from the very beginning.
* **Load Game:** Continue a previous journey.
* **Settings:** Customize your experience‚Äîfrom graphics to controls.
* **Credits:** See the names behind the project.
* **Exit:** Return to reality.

### In-Game HUD

During gameplay, the HUD provides all necessary information at a glance. It's designed to be intuitive so you can focus on the action.

* **Health Bar:** Your life force in this dangerous world.
* **Stamina Bar:** Determines how many attacks and dodges you can perform.
* **Aetherion Energy Bar:** Fills up as you fight, powering your unique abilities.
* **Quick Item Slots:** Quick access to essential items like potions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation Guide

### Before You Start

I want to make sure your setup process is as smooth as possible. Please make sure you have the following installed on your system before you begin.

* **Git:** A must-have for cloning the repository.
* **Git LFS (Large File Storage):** I use this to handle large assets like models and textures. Without it, you'll be missing crucial files!
* **Unity Hub:** To manage your Unity projects.
* **Unity 6:** The version of the engine I'm using. No more, no less!

### Let's Get Set Up

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or Git Bash and clone the repository with this command:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fragments-of-aetherion.git](https://github.com/your-username/fragments-of-aetherion.git)
    ```
2.  **Pull LFS Files:** After cloning, make sure you pull all the large files. This is a common step people forget!
    ```bash
    cd fragments-of-aetherion
    git lfs pull
    ```
3.  **Open in Unity Hub:**
    * Launch Unity Hub.
    * Click the "Add" button and select the `fragments-of-aetherion` folder.
    * Unity Hub will automatically detect the correct version (Unity 6) and open the project.

If you encounter any issues, please check our GitHub Issues page. I'm here to help!
